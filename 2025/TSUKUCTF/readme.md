# 🏴‍☠️ TsukuCTF 2025 Write-Up (03/5-04/5/25)

## 📋 Overview

**This week**, I participated in the **TsukuCTF (japan)** competition! 🎉  
I registered under the team name **ayamMAs** 🐔✨ — but actually, I was playing solo. 😎  
I managed to secure **240th place out of 882 teams**! 🏅  

This CTF was conducted in Japanese 🇯🇵, which added an extra layer of challenge and fun!  
Since I was a bit busy this week, I only had time to focus on the **OSINT** challenges — but I still learned a lot and had a great time participating.
