## Ask Nicely

I made this program, you just have to ask really nicely for the flag!

## Solution
Running the binary, it asks you
`How badly do you want the flag?` and then says `Ask nicely...`. 

Running strings on the binary, we find a string: 
```
pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty please with sprinkles and a cherry on top
```
We can assume this to be the key to getting the flag. 

Running the binary again, and using this as the response to "Ask nicely...", you get the flag. 

```
