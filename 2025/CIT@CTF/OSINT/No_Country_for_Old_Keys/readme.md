## No Country for Old Keys

What is Anthony McConnolly's API key?

## Solution
Since this challenge involves an API key, I first search this individual up on GitHub, and find [this profile](https://github.com/antmcconn).

On this profile, there is only one [repo](https://github.com/antmcconn/ai-web-browser/). Looking at the code, it seems that the API key has been replaced by a placeholder. So, we try going to previous commits, and find a commit labled `removed my API Key`. Clicking on this [commit](https://github.com/antmcconn/ai-web-browser/commit/c4138bedbaf2f0f04691a79045672bc815ca35d3), we find the API key.
