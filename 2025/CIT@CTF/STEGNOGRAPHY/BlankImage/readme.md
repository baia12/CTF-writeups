## Blank Image
I was gonna make a really cool challenge but then I literally forgot about it so all I have is this blank image. Good luck!

## Solution
Since this is a steg chall, I start by running steghide and binwalk, but I get no results. Then, I run zsteg on it, which helped me find the flag. hhuhu 
```c
dev@dev:~$ zsteg image.png
