## Solution
in this challenge we are given [eml file](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/eml) 
Looking at the .eml file in a text editor, we can notice a base64 encrypted string in the DKIM Signature:

```
V293LCB3aGF0IGEgYmVhdXRpZnVsIGxpdHRsZSBwb2VtLiBJIGFsbW9zdCBzaGVkI
	 GEgdGVhciByZWFkaW5nIHRoYXQuIEhvcGVmdWxseSB5b3UgbGVhcm5lZCBtb3JlIGFi
	 b3V0IGVtYWlsIGhlYWRlcnMuIEJ1dCBzZXJpb3VzbHksIGl0IGdldHMgbWUgd29uZGV

	 lfbDB2M19jdGYkX3QwMH0=
```
So we decode it using cyberchef:

```
Wow, what a beautiful little poem. I almost shed a tear reading that. Hopefully you learned more about email headers. But seriously, it gets me wondering... do you love CTFs as much as they do?
