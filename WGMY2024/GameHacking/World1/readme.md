## Overview  
I took on the challenge of defeating an overpowered enemy in a game built with RPG Maker MZ. 🎮 The enemy could one-shot kill my character 💀, so I had to find a way to turn the tide by modifying the save file to boost my character's stats. ⚔️  

## What I Did  

1. **Found the Save File**  
   After saving my game, I found a folder called `save` with a `.rmmzsave` file inside. 📂 This file contained all the details about my character.  

2. **Edited the Save File**  
   - I used [Save Editor Online](https://saveeditor.online/) 🌐 to open the `.rmmzsave` file.  
   - Tweaked my character’s health and attack to ridiculous levels. 💪  
   - Downloaded the updated save file.  

3. **Replaced the Save File**  
   I replaced the original `.rmmzsave` file in the `save` folder with my modified version.  

4. **Loaded the Game**  
   When I loaded the game, my supercharged character easily defeated the enemy. 🏆 Mission accomplished!
